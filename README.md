# all-about-pumpkins
The funkiest fall fruit there is

This is my first project hard-coding HTML, CSS and some javascript (no Bootstrap or frameworks used) to get a handle on basic web development concepts and how to structure elements on a page. Pumpkins and Halloween are pretty awesome, so I wanted to learn more about them and create a resourceful website dedicated to it.

Enjoy!

1. Types of pumpkins
2. How pumpkins grow/life cycle of a pumpkin
3. Gallery of images of pumpkins
4. History of the pumpkin/Halloween
5. Pumpkin fun facts

2. Building a responsive navbar/searchbar

4. Position: relative and Position: absolute
